# bosons-gpe

Solves dynamics for ultracold bosons on a lattice of arbitrary dimensions using the Truncated Wigner Approximation, which essentiall solves the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for an initial distribution over initial conditions.

Observables: condensate fraction, distribution function, two-point correlation function and spectral function.
